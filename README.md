Hi, I'm Osaretin Victoria Iyokho
Undergraduate Psychology Student | Future Computational Neuroscientist | NeuroAI Researcher in Training.
I'm deeply passionate about the intersection of neurocience, artificial intelligence, and bioengineering especially in developing intelligent systems that interface with the human brain.
My current focus includes: 
- Exploring how AI models can help us understand, stimulate and enhance neural activity.
- Building a foundation for research in neuroprosthetics, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and computational neuroscience.
- Preparing for a masters/PhD in NeuroAI or Bioengineering.
What i'm learning:
- Currently enrolled in several foundational Coursera courses:
      * Introduction to Python Programming
      * Computational Neuroscience - University of Washington
      * Machine Learning - Deep learning, amongst others
 My Projects and Goals includes:
  - Launching NeurotechX Nigeria Chapter in 2026
  - Developing beginner - level neuroscience-inspired projects in Python
  - Building a strong research portfolio to work with great leaders in the neuroscience and AI world.
Vision
  My long-term mission is to bridge psychology, neuroscience and artificial intelligence by designing brain-inspired technologies that empower both mental, medical and everyday human experience.
I aim to become Nigeria's first Neural engineers and inspire other young scientists to dream beyond boundaries.
